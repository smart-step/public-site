                    <div class="container-body">
                        The Smart-Step Lav system is the brainchild of successful business professional and entrepreneur Rich Davies. Rich is the CEO of Pavilion Development Company and Co-Founder of The Shepherd Hotels. He has spent more than 23 years developing commercial real estate throughout the US. Rich has witnessed first-hand the health issues, damage and high maintenance costs associated with his commercial property’s lavatories. Most importantly, he was disturbed witnessing staff having to clean urine from dirty grout-stained floors and walls in developed properties, and determined to find a way to improve conditions for cleaning staff, restroom users, tenants and property owners. He passionately believed there must be a way to improve upon the 100-plus-year-old urinal technology and outdated way of manufacturing urinals by inventing a method to provide a cleaner, fresh-smelling, hygiene friendly and cost-effective restroom environment.
                        <br><br>
                        It took Rich many years, but he was able to put his urinal concept on paper and have it engineered to address these and many other industry problems. Currently the men’s urinal industry is facing many daunting challenges that in the past were not always noticed or appreciated by the casual observer until more recent. With the global outbreak of COVID-19 it has forced people of the world to become much more aware and knowledgeable about the cleanliness and hygiene around them. More than ever, people are concerned about the spread of germs through bacteria attached to air particles (plumes), on various surfaces and within bodily fluids that can be transmitted unknowingly. Restrooms are a major contributor to the spread of disease as well as has become one of the more costly areas for upkeep within commercial properties throughout the world. The Smart-Step Lav urinal system’s proprietary design and surface material addresses these very concerning items and significantly helps reduce and, in some cases, eliminate the spread of germs all together.

                    <div class="container-body">
                        Smart-Step Lav is a novel step-in male urinal system that contains all splash, droplets and spray produced when urinating. It is a half egg-shaped, walk-in design which includes various angles that force urine away from the user’s body and thus significantly reduces splash-back. The shape is also designed to reduce any droplets produced after urination from “the shake”. The Smart-Step Lav includes a non-slip platform upon which a user will stand. The platform is slightly angled forward for easy drainage and containment. The surface of the platform has a non-slip configuration of raised rubber grooves and nodules. The Smart-Step Lav is made from a medical grade polymer that is lightweight yet very durable and has proprietary surface treatment that reduces splash and can be easily cleaned.
                        <br><br>
                        The Smart-Step Lav system has a walk-in design with curved walls and a horizontal shelf extending from the bathroom wall that is configured and treated to reduce splash as well as direct urine away from the user. These unique features prevent the spread of germs, reduces smell, keeps area clean around the urinal, reduces the need to replace adjacent flooring and walls along with grout. Another significant feature the Smart-Step Lav provides is a platform for which a user stands that is tilted slightly forward and includes a non-slip safe surface with raised grooves and nodules. This benefits the user by not having to stand directly in a pool of urine as is the case in most restrooms and therefore, the spread of it back to his home or office environment. The platform has a proprietary treated surface material that is very easy to clean and maintain which has made the Smart-Step Lav a very cost-effective urinal compared to the outdated urinal units that exist toda
