                        The Smart-Step Urinal system is the brainchild of successful business professional and entrepreneur Rich Davies. Rich is the CEO of Pavilion Development Company and Co-Founder of The Shepherd Hotels. He has spent more than 23 years developing commercial real estate throughout the US. 
                        <h3>Problem</h3>
                        Rich has witnessed first-hand the health issues, damage and high maintenance costs associated with his commercial property’s lavatories. Most importantly, he was disturbed witnessing staff having to clean urine from dirty grout-stained floors and walls in developed properties, and determined to find a way to improve conditions for cleaning staff, restroom users, tenants and property owners. He passionately believed there must be a way to improve upon the 100-plus-year-old urinal technology and outdated way of manufacturing urinals by inventing a method to provide a cleaner, fresh-smelling, hygiene friendly and cost-effective restroom environment.
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        It took Rich many years, but he was able to put his urinal concept on paper and have it engineered to address these and many other industry problems. Currently the men’s urinal industry is facing many daunting challenges that in the past were not always noticed or appreciated by the casual observer until more recent. With the global outbreak of COVID-19 it has forced people of the world to become much more aware and knowledgeable about the cleanliness and hygiene around them. More than ever, people are concerned about the spread of germs through bacteria attached to air particles (plumes), on various surfaces and within bodily fluids that can be transmitted unknowingly. Restrooms are a major contributor to the spread of disease as well as has become one of the more costly areas for upkeep within commercial properties throughout the world. The Smart-Step Urinal urinal system’s proprietary design and surface material addresses these very concerning items and significantly helps reduce and, in some cases, eliminate the spread of germs all together.

                    <div class="container-body">
                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        Smart-Step Urinal is a novel step-in male urinal system that contains all splash, droplets and spray produced when urinating. It is a half egg-shaped, walk-in design which includes various angles that force urine away from the user’s body and thus significantly reduces splash-back. The shape is also designed to reduce any droplets produced after urination from “the shake”. The Smart-Step Urinal includes a non-slip platform upon which a user will stand. The platform is slightly angled forward for easy drainage and containment. The surface of the platform has a non-slip configuration of raised rubber grooves and nodules. The Smart-Step Urinal is made from a medical grade polymer that is lightweight yet very durable and has proprietary surface treatment that reduces splash and can be easily cleaned.
                        <h3>Benefits</h3>
                        This benefits the user by not having to stand directly in a pool of urine as is the case in most restrooms and therefore, the spread of it back to his home or office environment. The platform has a proprietary treated surface material that is very easy to clean and maintain which has made the Smart-Step Urinal a very cost-effective urinal compared to the outdated urinal units that exist today.
